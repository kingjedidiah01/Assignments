# Assignment

HERE'S my submission for the week 3 to week 5 Tasks.

The week 3 task covered introduction to CSS.

The week 4 task is also on CSS and week 5 is on the understanding of how to work with GitHub.

It highlights my understanding of frontend Development and how i was able to work with the resources and the information given in the office hours on HTML AND CSS.

I still look forward to growing more as i take up more projects and tasks on the things I've learned so far and through the upcoming week's tasks and resources

Take your time to go through.
Don't forget to drop a comment.
Thanks.
