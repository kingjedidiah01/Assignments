My name is Mark Akinware, and here's the submission of the week 3 to week 5 Tasks.

The week 3 task covered introduction to HTML.

The week 4 task is on CSS and week 5 is on the understanding of how to work with GitHub.

It highlights my understanding of frontend Development and how i was able to work with the resources and the information given in the office hours on HTML AND CSS.

I still look forward to growing more as i take up more projects and tasks on the things I've learned so far and through the upcoming week's tasks and resources

Take your time to go through.

Thanks.
